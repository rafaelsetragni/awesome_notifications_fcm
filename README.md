# ‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏è <br> Users from `firebase_messaging` plugin

This plugin contains all features available in `firebase_messaging` plugin + all Awesome Notification features. Because of this, `awesome_notifications_fcm` plugin is incompatible with `firebase_messaging`, as both plugins will compete each other to acquire global notification resources.

So, you **MUST not use** `firebase_messaging` with `awesome_notifications_fcm`. All other Firebase plugins are compatible with awesome notification plugins.
    
To migrate **firebase_messaging** to **awesome_notifications_fcm**, please take a look at:  
[How to migrate firebase_messaging plugin](#how-to-migrate-firebase_messaging-plugin).

# üìù Important initial notes

1. ***Plugin Dependency:*** This plugin functions as an add-on of the [awesome_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications) plugin and inherently depends on it.
   
2. ***Notification Reliability:*** Be mindful that like local notifications, push notifications are not guaranteed to be 100% reliable. They may be delayed or denied due to factors such as battery-saving modes, background processing restrictions, and internet connection issues. Plan your business logic accordingly.
   
3. ***iOS Device Restrictions:*** On iOS, push notifications are exclusively delivered to real devices. However, other features may be tested using simulators.
   
4. ***Notification Troubleshooting:*** To investigate issues with notifications while the app is terminated, review the device logs. Utilize LogCat in Android Studio for Android, and "Console.app" on MacOS for iOS.
   
5. ***App Termination:*** Note that if your app is forcibly closed on any platform, all subsequent notifications will not be delivered until your app is actively reopened.

<br>
<br>


# üõ† Getting Started

In this section, you going to configure your Android and iOS project to use all features available in **awesome_notifications_fcm**:

<br>

## *Plugin Dependencies*

Add the plugins below as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file. By using the [awesome_notifications_core](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_notifications_core) plugin, the versions of all compatible dependencies are managed automatically:

```yaml
  # Awesome plugins
  awesome_notifications_core: ^0.7.6 # use the latest available
  awesome_notifications: any # <- this version will be managed by core plugin
  awesome_notifications_fcm: any # <- this version will be managed by core plugin
  
  # Firebase plugins
  firebase_core: ^X.X.X # use the latest available
  firebase_crashlytics: ^X.X.X # use the latest available
```
Note: Always ensure to use the latest versions of all these plugins.

<br>
<br>

## ü§ñ *Android Configuration*

1 - You MUST apply Google Play Services to your project to use FCM services. To do this, first, you need to import the `com.google.gms:google-services` package into your Android project by adding the line below in your `build.gradle` file, located in the "android" folder. (Ensure to use the latest version)

```gradle
buildscript {
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

2 - Then, you need to apply Google Play services by adding the line below at the end of the build.gradle file, located in the "android/app" folder.

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

Now, your Android project is configured to use `awesome_notifications_fcm`. *Awesome!!*

<br>
<br>

## üçé *iOS Configuration*

1 - First, ensure you have the latest XCode and cocoapods installed, with at least Swift 5.5.7.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/194728638-9cada1b9-4f2d-4a30-9fb3-3bb448f36017.png)

<br>

2 - Run the command `pod install` inside your iOS project folder.

Note: If it returns any version conflict, run `pod repo update` and `pod update` to update your local repository, and then rename or erase the file "Podfile.lock" inside your iOS folder. Lastly, try to execute the command `pod install` once again.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/194728843-5a5fd0a1-8540-4186-95e5-441fe5ebfd2f.png)

<br>

3 - To add pictures and buttons to iOS push notifications, it is necessary to create a *Notification Target Extension* using XCode. Target extensions are a type of lightweight application able to run in the background for specific tasks, in this case, to customize notifications before they are delivered.

To do this, open your Flutter project using XCode. Go to your iOS project folder and open the file *Runner.xcfworkspace*.

With your project opened, go to *"File -> New -> Target"*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/194728921-ae8c464c-a53b-4d93-a71a-ea417fc620ce.png)

... and chose "Notification Service Extension"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/194729005-3f645f12-f782-43fc-b686-6bad5a2f65e5.png)

... and add a name to your target extension at your choice (remember to make it clear that it's related to notifications).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/194729045-7956c95f-26ec-4f4a-9649-5f1bb0fbc575.png)

And once more, run the command `pod install` inside your iOS project folder.

At this moment, ensure that both targets have the same minimal deployment target and try to run your application. If you succeed up to this point, you should see a notification with a title ending with `[modified]`.


üòñ Here are some common issues that may arise at this step:

1 - My notification is being displayed, but without the title ending with `[modified]`.<br>
A - Your Notification Service Extension is not being called. This may happen if your NSE is not attached to your main Runner target.
Ensure that your NSE is attached to the Runner target and that both have the same minimal deployment target value.

2 - My application is not being compiled, and I got the error `DT_TOOLCHAIN_DIR cannot be used to evaluate LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS, use TOOLCHAIN_DIR instead`.<br>
A - Your CocoaPods or Xcode is outdated. You need to update or reinstall both of them, clear your project, and build everything again. Do not set your build to the legacy version as this is not the correct solution.

3 - My application is not being compiled, and I got the error `Cycle inside; building could produce unreliable results: Xcode Error`.<br>
A - You need to change the order of your build phases, moving the `Embed App Extensions` in front of `Link Binary with Libraries`. This may be necessary for some projects since Xcode 15.

<br>

4 - Now, it‚Äôs time to include the `Flutter` and `Awesome Notifications FCM` libraries in your *Notification Service Extension*. To achieve this, modify your "PodFile", appending the lines below at the file's end. Remember to replace the two instances of `MyAppServiceExtension` with the name of your service extension:

```Ruby
################  Awesome Notifications FCM pod mod  ###################
awesome_fcm_pod_file = File.expand_path(File.join('plugins', 'awesome_notifications_fcm', 'ios', 'Scripts', 'AwesomeFcmPodFile'), '.symlinks')
require awesome_fcm_pod_file
target 'MyAppServiceExtension' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
  
  install_awesome_fcm_ios_pod_target File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
end
update_awesome_fcm_service_target('MyAppServiceExtension', File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__)), flutter_root)
################  Awesome Notifications FCM pod mod  ###################
```
Then execute the command `pod install` to update your target extension.

<br>

5 - With these steps, your target extension can now utilize the awesome notifications library. Inside your Target extension folder, modify the file `NotificationService.swift`. Replace the class `UNNotificationServiceExtension` with `DartAwesomeServiceExtension` and erase all other Notification Service content. Your final file should resemble this:

```Swift
import UserNotifications
import awesome_notifications_fcm

@available(iOS 10.0, *)
class NotificationService: DartAwesomeServiceExtension {

}
```

<br>

6 - To ensure the app builds correctly, you must set specific `build settings` options for each of your app targets. In your project view, click on *Runner -> Target Runner -> Build Settings*...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40064496/195867655-c6cfc753-274e-4eff-b435-3d26e46e3b8a.png)

... and configure the following options:

In *Runner* Target:
* Build libraries for distribution => NO
* Only safe API extensions => NO
* iOS Deployment Target => 11 or greater

In your *NotificationServiceExtension* Target:
* Build libraries for distribution => NO
* Only safe API extensions => YES
* iOS Deployment Target => 11 or greater

<br>

7 - Lastly, it's essential to add three capabilities to your XCode project, especially "App Groups", which allows your target extensions to share data with each other.

Run your application and search on the debug console for the application group name automatically generated by Awesome Notifications. This name is unique for each application.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113704924/194730007-3e278bd3-a24d-481f-a99b-ae18a25ae36a.png)

Then, open your XCode project and navigate to Targets -> Runner -> Signing and Capabilities. Click on the "+" icon and add "App Groups", "Push Notifications", and "Background Modes", ensuring you check both "Background fetch" and "Remote notification" options.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113704924/194729763-adfb1d42-9bba-4aa5-908f-91eae574735e.png)

Under "App Groups", add the app group name automatically generated by Awesome Notifications. This name MUST start with "group.". Add the same "App Group" capability with the same app group name on your notification target extension.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113704924/194729936-eb5877b9-0ed1-43d5-879a-07a4f13f253e.png)

If you prefer using a custom name instead of the generated one, you can open each `info.plist` file of Runner and your NSE, and add the property `AwnAppGroupName` with your fixed app group name, ensuring it begins with "group.".


![image](https://github.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications_fcm/blob/3138a8311076e8a54a5830fa71532cd135e65847/example/assets/images/Screenshot-fixed-app-group.png?raw=true)

<br>

Now, your iOS project is configured to use `awesome_notifications_fcm`. *Awesome!!* (phew!)

üòñ Common Issues and Solutions:

1 - **Issue:** My notification is being displayed, but only with the simple title and body.

> Solution A: Ensure your Notification Service Extension (NSE) and main Runner target are connected via App Groups, using the same and valid App Group name starting with "group.".<br>

> Solution B: Your push content might not contain the flag "mutable_content" set to true.
 
> Solution C: If your push notification content is invalid, it will still be displayed on iOS. In such cases, "INVALID" is set as the category by Awesome Notifications. You can filter out these notifications, but you need Apple's permission to use this filter.

2 - **Issue:** The notification is displayed correctly with all awesome features when the app is in the Foreground. In Background or Terminated state, nothing happens.

> Solution: Utilize the "Console.app" on MacOS to track the device console in these states and read the logs to identify the problem.

3 - **Issue:** Tapping the notification when the app is closed causes the app to become translucent and then close itself.

> Solution: This occurs because apps built with Flutter can't run on iOS in debug mode without the debugger being attached. To resolve, open your project in XCode, go to Debugger > Attach to process by PID or name, and choose Runner. The debugger will be attached as your app starts up, allowing you to debug the app being awakened by a notification action (tap).

## üìù Important notes

1. ***iOS Push Notifications and IDs:*** iOS push notifications do not support IDs/Identifiers.

2. ***Device Restrictions:*** Push notifications are delivered exclusively to real devices. However, other features may be tested using simulators.

3. ***Delivery Assurance:*** Push notifications are invariably delivered, even amidst configuration, JSON package, or Notification Service Extension errors. In such scenarios, notifications appear in their simplest form. To mitigate this, notifications with errors are categorized as `"INVALID"`. You can filter this category by modifying your info.plist, albeit with Apple‚Äôs permission. Learn more at [com.apple.developer.usernotifications.filtering](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_usernotifications_filtering).
   
4. ***Setting "mutable_content":*** Ensure to set `"mutable_content"` to true. Failing to do so results in your notification bypassing the Notification Service Extension (NSE), and being delivered with only the original title and body content.

5. ***Setting "content_available":*** Set `"content_available"` to true to ensure the delivery of your silent push notification.

6. ***Badge Value Recommendations:*** It's advisable to set the badge value in both the notification and data sections. In cases of NSE failures, iOS reads the badge value from the notification section, while the Android FCM library requires it within the data section.

7. ***Frequency of Silent Push Notifications:*** Refrain from frequently sending silent push notifications as Apple may begin to restrict your device's background operation. Utilize the "Console.app" on MacOS to monitor the device's logs and ascertain any blocking.

8. ***User Inactivity:*** Note that your push notifications may be denied on iOS if users do not access your app for an extended period. This limitation is lifted once the user reopens your application manually.



<br>
<br>

# üçé‚Å∫ Extra iOS Setup for Background Actions

On iOS, to use any plugin inside background actions, you will need to manually register each plugin you want. Otherwise, you will face the MissingPluginException exception. To avoid this, you need to add the following lines to the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method in your iOS project's AppDelegate.m/AppDelegate.swift file:

```Swift
import Flutter
import awesome_notifications
import shared_preferences_ios
//import all_other_plugins_that_i_need

override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
      GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)

      // This function register the desired plugins to be used within a notification background action
      SwiftAwesomeNotificationsPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { registry in          
          SwiftAwesomeNotificationsPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.awesomenotifications.AwesomeNotificationsPlugin")!)          
          FLTSharedPreferencesPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.sharedpreferences.SharedPreferencesPlugin")!)
      }

      // This function register the desired plugins to be used within silent push notifications
      SwiftAwesomeNotificationsFcmPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { registry in          
          SwiftAwesomeNotificationsPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.awesomenotifications.AwesomeNotificationsPlugin")!)          
          FLTSharedPreferencesPlugin.register(
            with: registry.registrar(forPlugin: "io.flutter.plugins.sharedpreferences.SharedPreferencesPlugin")!)
      }

      return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
```
And you can check how to correctly call each plugin opening the file GeneratedPluginRegistrant.m

<br>
<br>
<br>

# üìã Creating a Firebase Project to send Push Notifications

To send push notifications using FCM (Firebase Cloud Message) you need to have an Firebase account with `Cloud Messaging` enable and copy the google-services.info (iOS) and google-services.json (Android) files at correct places. Also, you need to send to Firebase the APNs certificates to enable the comunication between Firebase and Apple servers. In this section we going to explain to you how to do all of that.

First, you need to create an Firebase account and activate the Firebase service called `Cloud Messaging`:

1. Sign in Firebase at https://firebase.google.com  
2. Click Go to console  
3. Click + Add project and follow the prompts to create a project. You can name your project anything you want  
4. Once the project is created, the project configuration page is automatically open. Search for the link `Cloud Messaging` and add the service into your Firebase Account  

After activate the service, a new configuration page will be displayed. This process can be repeated and edited if necessary at any time, for all platforms that you need.

In this configuration page, set correctly your app id and, on second section, download the file called google-services.info (iOS) or google-services.json (Android). The google-services.info must be placed inside the folder "ios/Runner" folder and the google-services.json must be placed inside "android/app/src" folder.

<br>

## üìÉ Adding APNs Certificate into your Firebase account

To allow Firebase send push notifications to iOS devices, its necessary to do an extra step to create the APNs certificate.

<br>

1. Go to https://developer.apple.com, sing into an Apple Account and go to "Certificates" and click on "+" button.  
2. Go to Services section and check **Apple Push Notification service SSL** and click on "Continue"  
3. Insert the same iOS App ID configured in your Firebase Cloud Messaging.   
4. In your MacOS machine, Launch Keychain Access app, located in /Applications/Utilities.   
5. Choose Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority.   
6. In the Certificate Assistant dialog, enter all information needed, leaving the CA Email Address field empty.  
7. Choose ‚ÄúSaved to disk,‚Äù then click Continue.  
8. Now, go back to the online certificate process and upload the certificate generated in your local machine to Apple  
9. Attention: Download the file and store it in a safe place. This file can be download only once.  
10. Lastly, upload this last certificate to Firebase in Project View -> Cloud Messaging -> Apple App Configurations. 

<br> 

And that's it! Now your Firebase is fully configured to send push notifications to iOS and Android.

<br> 
<br> 

# üì´ Requesting Firebase Token

There is two ways to send push notifications to a device:

* Getting the FCM token generated by Firebase. This token is unique for each user, device and app installed. Also, this token can be renewed by Firebase at any time.
* Sending a multicast message to a topic where the devices are subscribed on.

So, to send notifications, first you need to initialize `Firebase`, `AwesomeNotificationsFcm` and them request the FCM token. Is not always possible to generate the FCM token and this process depends on Internet connection.

```Dart

  ///  *********************************************
  ///     INITIALIZATION METHODS
  ///  *********************************************

  static Future<void> initializeRemoteNotifications({
    required bool debug
  }) async {
    await Firebase.initializeApp();
    await AwesomeNotificationsFcm().initialize(
        onFcmSilentDataHandle: NotificationController.mySilentDataHandle,
        onFcmTokenHandle: NotificationController.myFcmTokenHandle,
        onNativeTokenHandle: NotificationController.myNativeTokenHandle,
        // This license key is necessary only to remove the watermark for
        // push notifications in release mode. To know more about it, please
        // visit http://awesome-notifications.carda.me#prices
        licenseKey: null,
        debug: debug);
  }

  ///  *********************************************
  ///     REMOTE NOTIFICATION EVENTS
  ///  *********************************************

  /// Use this method to execute on background when a silent data arrives
  /// (even while terminated)
  @pragma("vm:entry-point")
  static Future<void> mySilentDataHandle(FcmSilentData silentData) async {
    print('"SilentData": ${silentData.toString()}');

    if (silentData.createdLifeCycle != NotificationLifeCycle.Foreground) {
      print("bg");
    } else {
      print("FOREGROUND");
    }

    print("starting long task");
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 4));
    final url = Uri.parse("http://google.com");
    final re = await http.get(url);
    print(re.body);
    print("long task done");
  }

  /// Use this method to detect when a new fcm token is received
  @pragma("vm:entry-point")
  static Future<void> myFcmTokenHandle(String token) async {
    debugPrint('FCM Token:"$token"');
  }

  /// Use this method to detect when a new native token is received
  @pragma("vm:entry-point")
  static Future<void> myNativeTokenHandle(String token) async {
    debugPrint('Native Token:"$token"');
  }
}
```

<br>

To request the FCM token, you can use `await` to wait for token be returned by the method `requestFirebaseAppToken` or intercept the token with your static method `myFcmTokenHandle`.

```Dart

  // Request FCM token to Firebase
  Future<String> getFirebaseMessagingToken() async {
    String firebaseAppToken = '';
    if (await AwesomeNotificationsFcm().isFirebaseAvailable) {
      try {
        firebaseAppToken = await AwesomeNotificationsFcm().requestFirebaseAppToken();
      }
      catch (exception){
        debugPrint('$exception');
      }
    } else {
      debugPrint('Firebase is not available on this project');
    }
    return firebaseAppToken;
  }

```

Send this token to your backend server and this way you got the "device address" to send notifications. Its recommended to also send the native token to your server, as not all push services are available by Cloud Messaging.

# üì£ Sending Push Notifications

## Using the Firebase Portal

<br>

To send notifications using the Firebase console, follow this excellent tutorial:
[Complete guide on sending Push using Firebase Cloud Messaging Console](https://enappd.com/blog/sending-push-using-firebase-console/35/)

<br>

## ‚úâÔ∏è Using Your Backend Server or Postman

<br>

To utilize all the features available in the legacy protocol when sending push notifications with Awesome Notifications, adhere to the standard below. Note that the Android and iOS sections are optional:

```Json
{
    "to" : "{{fcm_token_ios}}",
    "priority": "high",
    "mutable_content": true,
    "notification": {
        "badge": 42,
        "title": "Huston! The eagle has landed!",
        "body": "A small step for a man, but a giant leap to Flutter's community!"
    },
    "data" : {
        "content": {

                "title": "Android! The eagle has landed!",
                "payload": {
                    "android": "android custom content!"
                }
            }
        },
        "iOS": {
            "content": {
                "title": "Jobs! The eagle has landed!",
                "payload": {
                    "ios": "ios custom content!"
                }
            },
            "actionButtons": [
                {
                    "key": "REDIRECT",
                    "label": "Redirect message",
                    "autoDismissible": true
                },
                {
                    "key": "DISMISS",
                    "label": "Dismiss message",
                    "actionType": "DismissAction",
                    "isDangerousOption": true,
                    "autoDismissible": true
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

For sending the same content via the V1 protocol, transform each value inside the data section into a JSON encoded String. The expected data type is a String:String map.


```Json
{
  "message": {
    "token" : "{{fcm_token_ios}}",
    "android": {
      "priority": "high"
    },
    "apns": {
      "payload": {
        "aps": {
          "mutable-content": 1,
          "badge": 42,
        },
        "headers": {
          "apns-priority": "5"
        }
      }
    },
    "notification": {
        "badge": 42,
        "title": "Huston! The eagle has landed!",
        "body": "A small step for a man, but a giant leap to Flutter's community!"
    },
    "data" : {
        "content": "{\"id\":1,\"badge\":42,\"channelKey\":\"alerts\",\"displayOnForeground\":true,\"notificationLayout\":\"BigPicture\",\"largeIcon\":\"https://br.web.img3.acsta.net/pictures/19/06/18/17/09/0834720.jpg\",\"bigPicture\":\"https://www.dw.com/image/49519617_303.jpg\",\"showWhen\":true,\"autoDismissible\":true,\"privacy\":\"Private\",\"payload\":{\"secret\":\"AwesomeNotificationsRocks!\"}}",
        "actionButtons": "[{\"key\":\"REDIRECT\",\"label\":\"Redirect\",\"autoDismissible\":true},{\"key\":\"DISMISS\",\"label\":\"Dismiss\",\"actionType\":\"DismissAction\",\"isDangerousOption\":true,\"autoDismissible\":true}]"],
        "Android": "{\"content\":{\"title\":\"Android!Theeaglehaslanded!\",\"payload\":{\"android\":\"androidcustomcontent!\"}}}",
        "iOS": "{\"content\":{\"title\":\"Jobs!Theeaglehaslanded!\",\"payload\":{\"ios\":\"ioscustomcontent!\"}},\"actionButtons\":[{\"key\":\"REDIRECT\",\"label\":\"Redirectmessage\",\"autoDismissible\":true},{\"key\":\"DISMISS\",\"label\":\"Dismissmessage\",\"actionType\":\"DismissAction\",\"isDangerousOption\":true,\"autoDismissible\":true}]}"
    }
  }
}
```

## ü§ê Sending Silent Push Notifications

To send silent push notifications, avoid using the "notification" section. Use "content_available" instead of "mutable_content":

```Json
{
    "to" : "{{fcm_token_ios}}",
    "content_available": true,
    "priority": "high",
    "data" : {
        "data1": "fb787aa2-6387-4f65-a5a2-125f96ab4c14",
        "data2": "call_voice",
        "data3": "3c3079b7-ab5e-48a5-8c61-b64ebb4910a9",
        "data4": "5469846578",
    }
}
```

## Using REST Programs

You don't need a real server to send push notifications during the development stage. Use REST programs like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to emulate your backend for sending push notifications.

Download and import the Postman projects/collections below into your Postman. Make sure to replace the collection variables according to your Firebase project keys and your devices' tokens:

[V1 FMC Examples.postman_collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications_fcm/main/example/assets/readme/V1%20FMC%20Examples.postman_collection.json)<br>
[Legacy FMC Examples.postman_collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications_fcm/main/example/assets/readme/Legacy%20FMC%20Examples.postman_collection.json)


***Note:*** To use the V1 protocol on Postman, you'll need to generate a fresh token using the [Google Developers OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/). To generate it, follow the steps bellow:

1. **Authorize APIs**:
   - In Step 1, select the "Firebase Cloud Messaging API v1 > https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform".
   - Click "Authorize APIs".
   
2. **Login and Grant Access**:
   - Log in with the Google account linked to your FCM project on the Firebase console.
   - Allow the API to access your account.
   
3. **Exchange Authorization Code**:
   - In Step 2, click "Exchange authorization code for tokens".
   
4. **Refresh and Copy Access Token**:
   - Click "Refresh access token".
   - Copy the "Access token" and paste it into the respective field in your Postman collection variable.

By following these steps, you ensure that your Postman is configured with a valid access token for sending notifications using the V1 protocol.

# üöö How to Migrate `firebase_messaging` Plugin

Migrating from `firebase_messaging` requires you to replace Firebase methods with their equivalents in Awesome Notifications and Awesome Notifications FCM:

- `FirebaseMessaging.onMessageOpenedApp` -> `AwesomeNotifications.getInitialNotificationAction()`
- `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` -> `static Future<void> onActionReceivedMethod(ReceivedAction receivedAction)`
- `FirebaseMessaging.onBackgroundMessage` -> `static Future<void> mySilentDataHandle(FcmSilentData silentData)`
- `FirebaseMessaging.requestPermission` -> `AwesomeNotifications().requestPermissionToSendNotifications()`

## Accessing Non-Static Resources

To access non-static resources inside static methods, consider using design patterns such as Singleton classes or defining a Static Flutter Navigator Key in the MaterialApp widget.

## Switching Execution from Background to Main Isolate

To switch the execution from a background isolate to the main isolate of your application (where you have a valid context to redirect users), use the `ReceivePort` and `SendPort` classes. Below is a basic example:

```dart
import 'dart:isolate';

static ReceivePort? receivePort;
static Future<void> initializeIsolateReceivePort() async {
  receivePort = ReceivePort('Silent action port in main isolate')
    ..listen((silentData) => mySilentDataHandle(silentData));

  // This initialization only happens on main isolate
  IsolateNameServer.registerPortWithName(
      receivePort!.sendPort, 'silent_action_port');
}

@pragma('vm:entry-point')
void mySilentDataHandle(FcmSilentData silentData) {
    // this process is only necessary when you need to have access to features
    // only available if you have a valid context. Since parallel isolates do not
    // have valid context, you need redirect the execution to main isolate.
    if (receivePort == null) {
      print(
          'onActionReceivedMethod was called inside a parallel dart isolate.');
      SendPort? sendPort =
          IsolateNameServer.lookupPortByName('silent_action_port');

      if (sendPort != null) {
        print('Redirecting the execution to main isolate process.');
        sendPort.send(receivedAction);
        return;
      }
    }

    // Execute the rest of your code
}
```

In this example, `mySilentDataHandle` function is responsible for creating a `ReceivePort`, spawning a new isolate, and listening for messages from the new isolate. The handleData function in the new isolate sends a message back to the main isolate through the `SendPort`.

Following these steps will ensure a smooth transition from firebase_messaging to using Awesome Notifications for managing your push notifications.
