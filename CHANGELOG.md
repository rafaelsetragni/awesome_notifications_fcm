## [0.10.1] - 2025-02-19
### Fixed
- **Updated Android native library to fully support Flutter 3.27:** Removed deprecated Flutter V1 libraries on Android, ensuring compatibility with Flutter 3.27.

## 0.10.0 - 2024-10-11
### Breaking Changes
- **Pod Modifications:** Installation of `flutterfire_cli` is now necessary to configure Firebase with the latest features, ensuring the project is up-to-date with Firebase best practices.
- **iOS Minimum Deployment Target Increased to 13:** AUpdated the minimum deployment target for iOS to 13 to comply with the latest Firebase Core library restrictions.
- **Minimum Android SDK Increased to 23:** Elevated to utilize modern Android capabilities and security features, aligning with best security resources for Android platform.

### Improvements
- **Flutter 3.24.0 Compatibility:** Fully supporting the latest Flutter 3.24.0, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance across all platforms.

### Deprecations
- **Deprecation of `sendPushNotification` Method:**
  - As part of our transition to modern messaging patterns, the `sendPushNotification` method has been marked as deprecated. This change follows Google's announcement to decommission FCM upstream messaging in June 2024.  
  - Developers are now encouraged to implement a REST API on their server to handle communication from devices and use the Firebase Admin SDK to send notifications.  
  - The deprecated method now triggers a `NotImplementedError` with a clear message and detailed Javadoc documentation to guide developers in migrating to the new approach. This method will be **removed in version 1.0.0**.

### Enhancements
- **Dependencies Updated:** All project dependencies have been upgraded to their latest versions, ensuring the most secure, stable, and efficient operation.
- **Refreshed Documentation:** Comprehensive updates to our documentation make integrating and using Awesome Notifications clearer and more straightforward, enhancing developer experience and facilitating easier integration.

## 0.9.3 - 2024-03-15
### Enhancements
- Enhanced the Awesome FCM interpreter logic to prioritize Awesome Notifications customizations over Firebase remote configurations. This change allows developers to fully utilize Awesome Notifications features without being constrained by Firebase's configuration settings.

### Dependency Updates
- Updated all core dependencies to version 0.9.3, ensuring the package remains robust against the latest software environment changes and continues to provide a secure, efficient notification service.

## [0.9.2] - 2024-11-01
### Enhancements & Fixes
- **Refined Notification ID Handling for Stringify and Legacy Data Standards:** Altered the priority logic for push notification IDs in cases using stringify and legacy data standards. Now, Awesome IDs take precedence over Firebase IDs. This change enables more effective management of push notifications, allowing new notifications to replace or update previous ones with the same ID. It brings a higher level of control and dynamism to notification behavior.

## [0.9.1] - 01/04/2024
### Enhancements & Fixes
- **iOS Target Extension Deployment Flexibility:** Updated the iOS pod script to enable manual adjustments of the minimum target deployment. This improvement offers greater control and customization to developers in line with their specific iOS deployment needs.
- **Expanded Documentation on Data Standards:** Enhanced the documentation to provide comprehensive guidance on the three distinct data standards available for crafting push notifications via FCM. This update aims to clarify and streamline the notification creation process for developers.

## [0.9.0] - 01/02/2024
### Breaking Changes
- **Pod Modifications:** It's now necessary to add the Awesome Notifications pod modification inside the `Podfile` in the iOS folder.
- **Receive Port and Send Port:** The methods `sendPort.send()` and `receivePort!.listen()` now only accept serialized data, not objects. Convert your data to map format and reconstruct it later from this format.
- **License Key (Year 2):** With the start of year 2 support for the Awesome Notifications suite, updating your license keys is required. If your purchase was made less than 1 year ago, you're still under the 1-year purchase support and simply need to reply to the license email requesting a free update.

### Improvements
- **Flutter 3.16.0 Compatibility:** Fully supporting the latest Flutter 3.16.0, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.
- **Flattened Data Standard:** Introducing a new method for sending notifications using the V1 protocol without the need for Stringify. This streamlined approach simplifies the notification-sending process.
- **Full Firebase Console Support:** Leverage all features of Awesome Notifications directly via the Firebase console using the new flattened data standard, enhancing flexibility and control.
- **Postman Examples Updated with Flattened Standard:** All Postman examples have been updated to incorporate the new flattened data standard, while maintaining support for all other previous push patterns.

### Enhancements
- **Dependencies Updated:** All project dependencies have been upgraded to their latest versions, ensuring the most secure, stable, and efficient operation.
- **Refreshed Documentation:** Comprehensive updates to our documentation make integrating and using Awesome Notifications clearer and more straightforward.
